Business advisory services are the services provided with the intent for the success and growth of the success of the business. Advisors are a group of 5 to 6 people able to provide all the necessary information for the growth and success of the organization in every field. A very vast range of business advisors are available for every area and every effort is made to match the right advisor for the right applicant or client. 

Small businesses want, and need, someone to help them understand their numbers. Not everyone has passed the CPA exam or equivalent accounting qualification. Just as not everyone understands that profitability doesn’t necessarily mean viability.

For firms, the final frontier isn’t financial reporting, but instead, business advisory. With advanced financial knowledge, and an insight into your clients’ business strategy, providing that advice is the obvious next step.

But providing clients with strategic business planning services is not as time-consuming or complicated as it sounds. Instead, with the proliferation of tech-based solutions, accountants can easily bridge the gap between their knowledge and the clients’ needs.

## What Do We Offer:

### Compliance

The first of the three, compliance-based services, involves offering only the necessary services to keep clients compliant with the law. And keeping clients above the law is the very basic task of any accountant worth their salt.

Tax advisory, assurance, and bookkeeping, are examples of what’s typically known as compliance services, and these are usually billed by the hour.

But firms that offer only compliance services are now facing diminishing revenue and fewer customers as cloud computing streamlines and automates these processes.

### Performance

Performance services are services provided to monitor the health and performance of a business.

This section of the accounting pyramid is more involved in the here and the now, though it’s a step towards the final stage.

Growth profitability – that is, tracking the profit potential of a business – as well as business intelligence analysis, are the sectors that define this sector. It tends to be larger firms that operate in this area as they have invested more time, and money, in beginning to expand their client offering.

Because this section is a stepping stone to future-focused business advisory services it makes sense for accounting firms to begin offering performative analysis first, giving them a chance to understand what the customers want and how they react to value-add services.

### Advisory

Business advisory is the final tier of the accounting pyramid. Business advisory involves reporting on performance as well as advising on strategic plans, risk assessment, and succession plans.

In fact, Xero’s latest Accounting and Bookkeeping Industry Report found that firms each made an average of £124,600 from advisory services in the period of 2017-2018. For larger firms (pacesetting firms with 300+ clients) this number was more than tripled to £382,700.

The three pillars of the accounting world are being reconfigured – with some bearing more weight than others. Business advisory is slowly becoming the strongest option when it comes to the services offered by accounting firms.
